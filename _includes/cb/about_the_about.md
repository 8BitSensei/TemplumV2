## Contribute

Templum and its accompanying dataset is all open-source, meaning that it is all completely free and accessible to anyone. Being hosted on GitHub anyone can ‘fork’ a copy of the project, and make a change to their local version and commit the change to a ‘Pull Request’ (PR). The PR is then reviewed, and if approved is merged into the ‘master’ project.

## How to

An excellent practical guide on how to make a contribution to an open-source project is available [here](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions).
The Templum dataset is available [here](https://github.com/8BitSensei/RitualHub-Dataset) and the Templum Website [here](https://github.com/8BitSensei/Templum).

## Format

Entries into the Templum dataset must be made in the "sites": [] array and keep to the following format:

```json
{"site":"The common name for the site e.g. Maiden Castle",
"start":-50,
"end":123,
"location":"England, Dorset, Dorchester, Maiden Castle Road",
"description":"An appropriate description, ideally a paragraph or two that sums up the sites significance.",
"bibliography":[
"Cleary, S., 2014. The 'end of the gods' in late Roman Britain. Gallia, 71(1).",
"Sharples, N., Ambers, J., Armour-Chelu, M. et al., 1991. Maiden Castle: Excavations And Field Survey 1985-6. 1st ed. Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, Historic England."
]}
```

Locations should generally follow the format of Country, County, Townland, nearest road if possible.

## Useful Tools

Below are some useful tools we use in our workflow, all of which are free:

1. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - a lightweight IDE from Microsoft.

2. [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) - Git GUI client for Windows, Mac & Linux.

3. [JSTOR](https://www.jstor.org/) - JSTOR is a hugely popular digital library. However, most of the content is behind paywalls or requires organisational credentials, but a good place to start searching.

4. [Academia](https://www.academia.edu/) - an Academic social-networking site that also acts as a repository for free academic material.

5. Sci-Hub - One of the most important websites you can know about as an amateur scholar, sci-hub provides most paywall blocked articles for free. Do a quick Google for it as its address has to change often.

6. [Z-Library](https://z-lib.org/) - Similar to Sci-Hub, Z-Library is a file sharing site that provides a large corpus of books and articles for free.

7. [LibGen](http://libgen.li/) - LibGen is another academic file sharing site, but tends to not have Archaeology or Humanaties works so we don't use it nearly as often as Sci-Hub or Z-Library.

8. [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) - Zotero is a tool for collating and managing bibliographies.
